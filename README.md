### Q&A

**What's the best city in the world?**

Atlanta, GA, USA. üçë

**I went to Hartsfield-Jackson once on a layover, does that count?**

While Hartsfield-Jackson is a rockin' airport with a
[v. cool art installation](https://www.ajc.com/business/million-forest-walk-now-most-popular-artwork-hartsfield-jackson/Ngedn4THKiogkEuEWxya8J/) 
on the moving sidewalks between concourses A & B, you have not really been to Atlanta if you've only been to the airport.

**What're your main tech jams?**

DevOps + ML Eng = MLOps.
- Docker
- k8s
- Terraform
- Python
- GCP
- Bash because ultimately everything is bash isn't it

**Dude, why is your commit history basically empty?**

While I was working on 
[open](https://github.com/CODAIT/spark-bench) 
[source](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.cassandra) 
[stuff](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) for awhile,

**Do you do frontend?**
